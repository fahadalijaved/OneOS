/**
 * The OneOS root script (`app/src/full/assets/root/oneos_root.sh`, OneOS
 * only: OneOS Probe ships no root script) and the launcher that runs it
 * (friend build 2, AA10).
 *
 * Every root command that changes something is `su -c "<launcher>"`: a fixed
 * text with only the verb's arguments, the script's pinned SHA-256 and its
 * length filled in. The launcher runs `$STAGE/bin/oneos_root.sh` only when
 * the stage, its `bin` folder and the script are root's (writable by root
 * only, not links) and the script's SHA-256 is the pinned one; never the
 * app-writable copy the read-only lists run from. Only `begin` may install the
 * script first, and `recover` into a stage OneOS already prepared (an older
 * build's script in `bin`, so its unfinished session can still be restored):
 * then the app writes the script to su's stdin, and the launcher checks the
 * same hash before it moves it into place and runs it. `old-list` and `purge`
 * (0.3.5) may install it the same way as `recover`, so old stages can be
 * listed and deleted right after an app update.
 *
 * The stage's path up to 0.3.6 was [LEGACY_STAGE] (OneLineage's name). While
 * there is nothing at [STAGE] and the old path is a folder, the launcher works
 * on the old stage exactly as on the new one, and the script renames it to
 * [STAGE] before its verb, only while it is idle (`migrate_legacy`), with its
 * set-aside copies (`lineage_stage.old-*` to `oneos.old-*`, the same suffix).
 *
 * Arguments are fixed words, decimal numbers and lowercase hex only
 * ([problems]), so nothing in the command needs quoting. `begin` and `finish`
 * name the profile, the image and its file set (root refuses a set that is not
 * that image's on that phone); `launch` carries this launch's
 * `ONEOS_GUEST_HIDE_GMS`, `ONEOS_HEAT_CAP`, `ONEOS_GUEST_SEC_IMS` and (0.4.32)
 * `ONEOS_GUEST_EDM_STUB` (0 or 1 each).
