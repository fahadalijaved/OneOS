# OneOS root script, app 0.3.7 (versionCode 11): every change the OneOS app
# makes to the phone as root is one of the verbs below, and nothing else.
#
# The app never runs this file from its own storage. Its launcher
# (RootScript.kt, a fixed text) runs only $STAGE/bin/oneos_root.sh (while
# there is no $STAGE, the old stage's: $LEGACY/bin/oneos_root.sh, which
# migrate_legacy then renames), owned by root and writable by root only, and
# only when its SHA-256 equals the hash pinned in the app's BuildConfig. `begin` may first install it there, and
# `recover` into a stage OneOS prepared (an older build's script in bin, so its
# unfinished session can still be restored): the launcher reads it from stdin
# and checks the same hash before it runs.
# Arguments are fixed words, decimal numbers and hex SHA-256 only.
#
#   begin <new|keep|aside> <profile> <image> <set> <versionCode>
#           new: the stage must be empty. keep: adopt the stage and its guest
#           data (the guest's /data), only for the image that made that data
#           and never another system's (image_family).
#           aside: rename the stage to oneos.old-<epoch> and start an
#           empty one. <set> must be the file set of <image> on <profile>
#           (profile_set, set_image).
#   receive <name> <bytes> <sha256>   stdin: exactly <bytes> bytes of <name>

#                                     stage moves aside, oneos.old-<name> back
#   remove                            delete everything OneOS put on the phone
#                                     (0.4.25): every copy, the stage, the log
#                                     capture and the session's helper files
#
# Writes: only under $STAGE. Documented exceptions, nothing else:
#   - begin aside renames $STAGE to its sibling $STAGE.old-<epoch>;
#   - restore renames $STAGE to $STAGE.old-<epoch> and one
#     oneos.old-<epoch>[-<pid>] that has a stage marker to $STAGE, only when
#     neither has anything mounted at or under it in any readable mount table,
#     no loop device uses a file in either, no bridge is up and neither holds
#     a session still open or one that never returned (a session earlier in
#     this boot that returned is fine); if the second rename fails, the first
#     is undone;
#   - remove moves $DATA/local/tmp/oneos_logs and the session's six helper
#     files there (adb_watchdog.sh/.log, ims_watchdog.sh/.log,
#     ui_activator.log, restore_app.log) into the stage, purges every copy,
#     then renames the stage to $STAGE.old-<epoch> and purges it, all after
#     purge's and restore's checks for every one of them;
#   - purge renames one oneos.old-<epoch>[-<pid>] to oneos.trash-<epoch>
#     and deletes it, only when it is root's, not a link, nothing is mounted
#     at or under it in any readable mount table, no loop device uses a file
#     in it, no bridge is up and it holds no session of this boot (checked
#     before the rename and again after it);
#   - launch moves itself out of the app's cgroup (/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.procs)
#     and starts oneos_switch.sh, the session, in init's mount namespace;
#   - recover runs the staged guest_props.sh recover (resetprop);
#   - before its verb, every run renames the stage and its copies from their
#     names up to app 0.3.6 (lineage_stage, lineage_stage.old-*, .trash-*) to
#     the OneOS names, each only while it is idle (migrate_legacy).
# Apart from purge (and remove, through it), nothing is ever deleted except this script's own files: incoming/*.part,
# incoming/plan and incoming/received, and an old system.raw that a new one
# replaces (an image, never user data). Everything else that is in the way is
# moved to $STAGE/attic/<epoch>/. Every refusal comes before the first change
# of its verb (`@@REFUSED <why>`, exit 2); bad arguments exit 3, a failed
# write exits 4 (`@@FAILED <what>`). The renames of migrate_legacy are no
# verb's: they come first, and stay when the verb then refuses.
#
# Tests (StageScriptTest, under dash and busybox ash) set ONEOS_TEST_ROOT to a
# fake root folder: every path below gets that prefix, and launch refuses after
# its checks and its session.env line, before anything starts. As uid 0 the
